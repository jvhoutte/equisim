# Target doc definition
# The challenge here is that the sub projects must all define a custom target but with different names to avoid
# conflicts. We also want to be able to issue "make doc" from the top dir while being able to issue "make doc"
# in the subdirs *when* we compile only a subproject.
# We define as well a function AddDocTarget in cmake/DoxygenTarget.cmake
